  - Welcome, our empergod, to NOVA! We're going to give you teach you the basics
    to expand and rule over your new solar system.
  - Time is measured in "solar cycles". You can pause time, or swap between x1, x2
    or x4 speed through the icons on the bottom left corner.
  - 'On the top left corner you have your available resources. They''re, from left
    to right: Stone, Metal, ice, Fire and Sand.'
  - Each resource has different uses, and must be generated through planets.
  - On the bottom right corner you have the 'Building' menu. Through here, you can
    build planets and Satellites. For planets, first pick the one you want to build
    and then select a free spot on your solar system. For satellites, you'll have
    to select a planet to build it on its orbit.
  - Planets cost resources. Once paid, you'll start building the planet, which will
    take a number of solar cycles. Once built, the planet will generate the same
    resource types it cost you to build it.
  - On the bottom of the screen you have a few icons that represent different menus.
  - One of these menus is the quest menu, which will display available quests, their
    requirements, as well as time constraints and rewards.
  - Check out the quests menu and complete your first quest to continue.
