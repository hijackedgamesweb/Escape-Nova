  - We did it! The species seems to call themselves 'Mippip'. We could really bennefit
    from this relationship, though we should be carefull not to anger or bother them.
    It seems like our actions could have consequences in our relationship from now
    on.
  - Now that we've reached this level of scientific wonder, pehaps it is time to
    reach even further. You should check these new research recipees.
  - New lost signals seem to have reached us. We can probably create translator to
    understand them too. But perhaps we should be carefull with who reaches out to
    us...
