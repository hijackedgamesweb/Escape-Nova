  messages:
  - 'Now you have unlocked two new menus: Research and Inventory. You can see them
    at the bottom of the screen.'
  - The storage menu will alow you to craft and store items, which will become very
    useful very soon.
  - The research menu will allow to unlock new planets, items, satellites and more,
    by researching them. Each research will cost resources and take a certain ammount
    of solar cycles to finish, but once a research is done it's unlocked forever.
  - Your next objective is to research "Primal Planets", so check out the research
    menu and let the science begin.
