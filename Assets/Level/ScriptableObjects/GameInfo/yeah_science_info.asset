  messages:
  - 'Now that the S.T.A.R.S has been built, you have unlocked two new menus: the
    "Research" and "Storage" menu. '
  - Through the storage menu you cann craft and check out your available objects.
    You don't seem to have any as of yet, but they will come in handy very soon...
  - The research menu allows you to unlock new planets, objects, satellites, and
    much more!
  - To research anything you will have to pay a certain ammount of  resources and
    wait for the research to be complete. Once finished, said research will be unlocked
    forever.
  - To complete your next quest you have to research "Primal Planets", so you should
    check the menu right now, our Empergod.
