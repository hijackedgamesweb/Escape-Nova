  civilizationDescription: As the primary suppliers of the rare quartz crystals essential
    for space travel, the Handoull are the cornerstones of the galactic economy.
    While they present themselves as a democracy, their governance appears to be
    a complex web of merchant families and trade guilds. They are experts in negotiation
    and logistics, capable of supplying advanced technology to any system that can
    meet their terms. Their agreements are legendary for their detail and length,
    often requiring a sharp eye to understand the full scope of the exchange
