  civilizationDescription: Originating from the distant sector of Kepler 452b, the
    Akki are an elusive presence in the stellar charts. Their political structure
    is undefined, though their erratic behavior suggests a form of anarchy governed
    by principles that may be more quantum than social. They leave behind traces
    of fractal symbols and complex harmonies, drifting through systems without establishing
    permanent roots. To an observer, they appear to be watching the universe unfold,
    though their silence makes it impossible to know if they are merely witnesses
    or if they are waiting for a specific moment to act
