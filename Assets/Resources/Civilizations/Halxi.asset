  civilizationDescription: "The Halxi civilization developed in an environment highly
    toxic to most other species, who need a life of biological isolation. \n\nThey
    operate under a unique democracy of total neural unanimity, where no action is
    taken unless every mind in the network agrees. \n\nThis collective connection
    was forged to survive a volatile history, resulting in a society that moves with
    deliberate, unified slowness. \n\nInteracting with a Halxi means facing a wall
    of silence, as their debates happen internally and instantaneously, presenting
    a consensus that is often impossible to sway"
